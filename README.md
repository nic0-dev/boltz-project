# $BOLTZ (BLTZ): Decentralized Net Metering and Tracking System on Arbitrum Blockchain

Champion Submission for Meralco's IDOL Hackathon 2024. <br>
Developed by Team KuryentEEE.

## Overview

$BOLTZ is a **Decentralized Net Metering and Tracking System** built on the Arbitrum Blockchain. It empowers users to:
- Track energy consumption and generation in real-time.
- Exchange excess generated energy for $BOLTZ tokens.
- Use $BOLTZ tokens for rewards, bill deductions, and other incentives.
This solution aligns with Meralco's sustainability and energy efficiency goals, leveraging blockchain technology to improve transparency and incentivize renewable energy adoption.
